## Acknowledgment

The core of this application was built with an online free tutorial of RocketSeat(Check the links below), with some improvements on frontend, and sooner, a MongoDB integration. &nbsp;
Rocketseat is a Youtube Channel and a Web Plataform that offer online courses, I really recommend their work, there are a lot of stunning courses for free, and paid classes that are very worthwhile. Check the platafrom by the links below: &nbsp;
